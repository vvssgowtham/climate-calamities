          <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
          <p>
            Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, which are
            highly complex to model. The research on the advancement of flood
            prediction models contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion,
            minimization of the loss of human life, and reduction of the
            property damage associated with floods. To mimic the complex
            mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during the
            past two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly
            in the advancement of prediction systems providing better
            performance and cost-effective solutions.
            <br /> Due to the vast benefits and potential of ML, its popularity
            dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers through
            introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing ones
            aim at discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models.
            The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state of
            the art of ML models in flood prediction and to give insight into
            the most suitable models.
            <br />
            In this paper, the literature where ML models were benchmarked
            through a qualitative analysis of robustness, accuracy,
            effectiveness, and speed are particularly investigated to provide an
            extensive overview on the various ML algorithms used in the field.
            The performance comparison of ML models presents an in-depth
            understanding of the different techniques within the framework of a
            comprehensive evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper
            introduces the most promising prediction methods for both long-term
            and short-term floods.
            <br />
            Floods pose significant threats to life, property, and
            infrastructure worldwide. Accurately predicting flood events can
            enable proactive mitigation and preparedness strategies, reducing
            associated risks and damages. However, due to the complex interplay
            of various factors like rainfall, topography, and land use,
            traditional flood prediction models often fall short in their
            accuracy and adaptability.
            <br />
            Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality of the flood
            prediction models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data
            decomposition, algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are
            reported as the most effective strategies for the improvement of ML
            methods. This survey can be used as a guideline for hydrologists as
            well as climate scientists in choosing the proper ML method
            according to the prediction task.
            <br />
            <br />
            Objective:
            <br />
            This paper explores the application of advanced machine learning
            (ML) techniques for improved flood prediction. We aim to demonstrate
            the potential of ML in capturing intricate relationships within
            flood data and generating more accurate and timely predictions.
            <br />
            Introduction: Floods occur due to various factors, including
            excessive rainfall, rapid snowmelt, storm surges, dam failures, and
            coastal flooding. Climate change is exacerbating these risks with
            increased precipitation intensity and sea level rise.
            <br />
            Impacts: Floods can cause devastating consequences, including: •
            Loss of life and injury: <br />
            Floods are one of the most deadly natural disasters globally,
            displacing millions and causing severe health risks.
            <br />• Economic damage: Infrastructure damage, disrupted
            businesses, and agricultural losses lead to significant economic
            burdens.
            <br />• Environmental damage: Soil erosion, contamination of water
            sources, and disruption of ecosystems further compound the effects.
            <br />
            <br />
            Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to assess floods.
            ML algorithms can analyze large amounts of data, including
            geospatial environmental layers, past flood inventory, and historic
            climatic records, to improve flood risk and impact assessments.
            <br />
            ML methods can also be used to develop predictive hazard
            assessments, flood susceptibility maps, and flood damage models. For
            example, ML algorithms can be used to estimate flood susceptibility
            by analyzing relationships between dependent and independent
            variables, such as hydrogeological, topographical, and geological
            factors.
            <br />
            ML can also be used to predict flood events by analyzing undetected
            trends in historical meteorological data. Flood forecasting is
            another area where ML is being used, with models being developed to
            predict flood hydrographs and flood development. Overall, ML has the
            potential to improve the accuracy of flood assessments and reduce
            the time and cost of model development. However, issues such as data
            limitations, applicability, bias, and ethics must be considered
            carefully to avoid misuse.

            techniques like data cleaning, scaling, and transformation are
            discussed.

            such as ensemble models, Deep Learning architectures (e.g., Long
            Short-Term Memory networks), and hybrid approaches combining
            traditional models with ML. Key characteristics and learning
            processes of these techniques are elaborated.

            Data acquisition and preprocessing are crucial steps in building
            effective flood prediction models using advanced machine learning
            (ML). Here's a deeper dive into this aspect:
            <br /> <strong>Data Sources:</strong>

            <strong>Data Splitting:</strong><br/>Splitting the preprocessed data into training,
            validation, and testing sets.<br/>The effectiveness of advanced ML
            techniques in enhancing flood prediction accuracy compared to
            traditional methods.<br/>Identification of the most suitable ML
            algorithms for specific flood prediction scenarios based on data
            characteristics and prediction requirements.<br/>Insights into the
            interpretability and explainability of ML models for flood
            prediction, aiding decision-making and trust in predictions.<br/>
            Splitting preprocessed data into training, validation, and testing
            sets is a crucial step in developing and evaluating flood prediction
            models using advanced machine learning. Here's a detailed breakdown
            of this process:<br/><br/><strong>1. Purpose of Each Set:</strong><br/>Training Set: Used to train
            the machine learning model. The model "learns" from this data by
            adjusting its internal parameters to minimize prediction errors.
            Typically, it comprises the largest portion (e.g., 70%) of the
            dataset.<strong>Validation Set:</strong>Used to fine-tune the model's
            hyperparameters (settings that control its learning process) on
            unseen data. This prevents overfitting, where the model performs
            well on training data but poorly on new data. The validation set is
            usually smaller than the training set (e.g., 15%).<br/><strong>Testing Set:</strong>Used
            to evaluate the final performance of the trained model on completely
            unseen data. This set provides an unbiased estimate of how well the
            model will generalize to real-world flood prediction scenarios. It's
            the smallest set (e.g., 15%).<br/><br/><strong>2. Splitting Strategies:</strong>Several
            strategies can be employed for splitting data, each with its
            advantages and considerations:<br/><strong>Random Sampling:</strong> Simplest approach,
            involves randomly shuffling the data and splitting it into desired
            proportions. Works well for most datasets but may not guarantee
            representative sub-samples if data exhibits strong patterns or
            trends.<br/><strong>Stratified Sampling:</strong> Ensures each split (training,
            validation, testing) reflects the same class distribution (flood/no
            flood) as the original data. This is crucial for imbalanced datasets
            where flood events occur less frequently.<br/><strong>Time-Based Split:</strong>
            Especially important for time series data like flood prediction.
            Splits data chronologically, ensuring the model is evaluated on
            future (unseen) periods. Common approach includes using the last
            portion of data for testing and earlier parts for
            training/validation.<br/><strong>Rolling Window Approach:</strong> Creates multiple
            training and validation sets by sliding a window across the time
            series data. This technique allows evaluating the model's
            performance at different points in time and captures evolving trends
            or seasonality.<br/><strong>3. Considerations for Flood Prediction:</strong><br/> Seasonality
            and Long-Term Trends: Flood datasets often exhibit seasonality and
            long-term trends. Ensure splitting strategies preserve these
            characteristics across sets to avoid misleading evaluations.<br/>
            <strong>Imbalanced Classes: </strong>Address class imbalance (fewer flood events) by
            using stratified sampling or oversampling/undersampling techniques
            specifically suited for imbalanced data.<br/><strong>Time Dependence:</strong> Account
            for the temporal nature of flood data by using time-based splits or
            rolling window approaches to capture sequential relationships and
            model future events effectively.<br/><strong>4. Choosing the Right Strategy:</strong> The
            optimal splitting strategy depends on your specific dataset
            characteristics, model type, and research objectives. Carefully
            consider the factors mentioned above to choose the most appropriate
            approach for reliable and generalizable flood prediction models.
